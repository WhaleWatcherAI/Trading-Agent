🧠 FABIO AGENT - VOLUME PROFILE & ORDER FLOW TRADING
================================================================================
Symbol: NQZ5
Playbook: The market is an auction oscillating between balance (rotation around fair value) and imbalance (directional discovery away from prior value). The agent only trades when market state, location relative to volume-profile structure, and order-flow aggression all align.
Risk per trade: 0.25-0.5%
Dashboard: http://localhost:3337
